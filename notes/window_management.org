* Windows and Frames

- A "window" is a region within an Emacs frame that shows a particular buffer
- A "frame" is an Emacs program window at the level of your OS or desktop environment which can hold multiple windows
- Multiple windows can show the same buffer, but with different scroll, selection, etc

* Basic Window Operations

| Command                             | Key   | Description                            |
|-------------------------------------+-------+----------------------------------------|
| =delete-window=                       | ~C-x 0~ | Close the current window               |
| =delete-other-windows=                | ~C-x 1~ | Close all other windows                |
| =split-window-below=                  | ~C-x 2~ | Split the current window horizonally   |
| =split-window-right=                  | ~C-x 3~ | Split the current window vertically    |
| =shrink-window-horizontally=          | ~C-x {~ | Make the window smaller horizontally   |
| =enlarge-window-horizontally=         | ~C-x }~ | Make the window bigger horizontally    |
| =shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer= | ~C-x -~ | Shrink the window vertically to buffer |
| =balance-windows=                     | ~C-x +~ | Balance the sizes of all windows       |

*TIP*: The =universal-argument= (~C-u~) and a numeric prefix can be used to dictate the mount by which the window is resized.

** evil-mode alternatives

| Command                | Key        | Description                             |
|------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------|
| =evil-window-delete=     | ~C-w C-c~    | Close the current window                |
| =delete-other-windows=   | ~C-w C-o~    | Close all other windows                 |
| =evil-window-split=      | ~C-w C-s~    | Split the current window horizontally   |
| =evil-window-vsplit=     | ~C-w C-v~    | Split the current window vertically     |
| =evil-window-set-width=  | ~C-w (pipe)~ | Use numeric prefix to set window width  |
| =evil-window-set-height= | ~C-w _~      | Use numeric prefix to set window height |
| =balance-windows=        | ~C-w =~      | Balance the sizes of all windows        |

*TIP*: A numeric argument before running =evil-window-set-width= and =evil-window-set-height= to specify the desired size of the window.

* "Other window" operations

| Command                  | Keys    | Description                                      |
|--------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------------------|
| =other-window=             | ~C-x o~   | Select the next visible window                   |
| =find-file-other-window=   | ~C-x 4 f~ | Open a file in another window                    |
| =dired-other-window=       | ~C-x 4 d~ | Open Dired in another window                     |
| =dired-jump-other-window=  | ~C-x 4 j~ | Open Dired in another window at location of file |
| =scroll-other-window=      | ~M-pgdn~  | Scroll the other window down without focusing it |
| =scroll-other-window-down= | ~M-pgup~  | Scroll the other window up without focusing it   |

** evil-mode alternatives

| Command           | Keys    | Description                        |
|-------------------+---------+------------------------------------|
| =evil-window-next=  | ~C-w C-w~ | Select the next visible window     |
| =evil-window-prev=  | ~C-w W~   | Select the previous visible window |
| =ffap-other-window= | ~C-w C-f~ | Open a file in another window      |
